# Demystifying terminology for Code Newbies

Getting started as a developer can sometimes be overwhelming. There is a multitude of terms, concepts, and acronyms vital to becoming proficient as a software developer. The goal with this post, is to define the fundamental terms, concepts, and acronyms necessary to read and understand technical blogs and documentation, so that `#codenewbies` can "hit the ground running". 

## The Fundamentals 

### Programming, Syntax, Statements, & Expressions

In the context of Computer Science, the term "coding" is often used synonymously with "programming". Loosely defined, "programming" is the process in which instructions and information are strictly defined in a format that can be understood by a computer. Programming or coding is used to create a **package** or **program**. 

The information and instruction are sequenced into small units of work commonly called "statements" or "expressions". The term "statement" is often used interchangeably with the term "expression" because they have very similar meanings, however it should be noted that they are non synonymous.

The format of code is defined by a strict set of rules called "syntax". Syntax describes the way in which Syntax is not universal. Most programming languages require different These detailed instructions must adhere to strict rules known as "syntax". **Syntax** is the rules and format unique to the programming language used. Syntax defines the characters and 

The process "programming" (i.e. "coding") results in a plain text file called a "program". Most developers and software engineers today create programs written in "high-level" languages**. Most programming languages abstract a the actual steps a computer takes, and cannot be run directly by a computer. The plain text file is then translated through a process known as **compilation**, to create an **executable**. **Executables** are files that have been translated from plain text into **machine code**, which is the 

A **program** is the result of "programming". It is a text-file composed of sequenced units of work referred to as "statements" and "expressions". Statements and expressions both represent single piece of information or a single unit of work (e.g. "instruction"/"operation"). A program bundles  statements and expressions (in order) necessary to accomplish a particular outcome into a text file. Statements and expressions both define a single instruction to be executed by a computer. The difference between a statement and an expression lies in the way they are evaluated ("processed"). A statement define an action or step, while an expression is a statement that evaluates (i.e. "results") in a value (e.g. `true`, `false`, `10`, `49.59`, 'B', "Sarah" ...). 

### Callable Units 

The term "callable units" is an umbrella term describing the grouping of a specific sequence of statements and expressions that _can_ be "called" or executed repeatedly. In software, callable units allow developers to repeat a sequence of instructions one or more times in exactly the same way each time. 

Callable units are broken down into more specific sequences of repeatable operations known as "procedures", "methods", "functions", "routines" and "subroutines". 














### Compilation  


  
Differentiating between the two has limited value, but if you're reading this, you're probably curious.

* **Block** 
  
  * A _scoped_ combination of _statements/expressions__ that represent the instructions necessary to accomplish a task.
