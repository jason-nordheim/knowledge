# Getting Started with Gradle 

## What is Gradle? 

Gradle is a flexible, **open-source** build automation tool designed to build a wide variety of software. 

Core Features: 
1. High Performance  
  * Avoids unneccessary work - inteligently determines if inputs or outputs have changed and runs only necessary tasks 
  * Offers ability to re-use task outputs via a shared cache 
2. JVM Foundation (Java)
  * Need Java and the JDK installed to use 
  * Can utilize standard Java APIs in build logic 
  * Makes gradle multi-platform 
3. Convention 
  * Common tasks/projects can be implemented quickly following standard naming conventions (project structure, variable naming)
  * Declarative, rather than imperative logic 
4. IDE Support 
  * Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans are all supported 
5. Build Scans 
  * Scan projects to quickly identify built/performance issues 

## Core Concepts 

1. Multipurpose - By making few assumptions about what is being built or how it should be built, Gradle is a build tool that works in a wide variety of projects. Plugins enable quick setup and extension of project functionality following standard conventsions 
2. Task Model - Gradle's build's are essentially a collection of tasks wired together 
3. Fixed Build phases - Gradle evaluates and executes builds in three phases - initialization, configuration and exectuion 
4. Extensibility - gradle comes with mechanisms enabling custom build logic for custom tasks, custom task actions, extra properties, custom conventions, and custom models 
5. Abstraction - gradle's build scripts execute against Java, Groovy, or Kotlin APIs - allowing developers to focus on what steps need to be performed (declarative), rather than how they should be performed (imperative). 

### Plugins  

Plugins - plugins enable you to extend gradle project's capabilities quickly with common tasks implemented following standard naming conventions. 

### Tasks 

Gradle builds are comprised of _tasks_. Each task is a piece of work that the gradle builder will run. As _tasks_ are added to gradle project's they are wired together by their dependencies. We visually represent the dependencies between tasks using [Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)](!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Topological_Ordering.svg/1200px-Topological_Ordering.svg.png). Organizing tasks this way allows gradle to intelligently re-compile those _tasks_ when a change is made directly to that task's source-code or to the source-code of one of its dependencies and enables gradle only recompile code when required. 

There are three types of tasks, _actions_, _inputs_, _outputs_. 

1. _Actions_ are pieces of work that do something (e.g copy a file, compile code)
2. _Inputs_ values, files, directories that are used in _actions_
3. _Outputs_ files and directories that are modified or generated by _actions_

### Build Phases 

1. Initialization 
  * Environment Setup 
  * Determine included projects 
2. Configuration 
  * Construction and configuration of the task graph (DAG)
  * Determines the order of build for the tasks based on the dependencies in the DAG graph 
3. Execution 
  * Runs the selected task (and any depedent tasks intelligently)


### Extending gradle 

Gradle is designed to with mechanisms that enable you to create: 

1. Custom tasks 
  * If a standard task will not perform the necessary work, simply define your own (It is recommended that the source file for a custom task be placed in the `buildSrc` directory or via a packaged plugin - this way the custom task can be used like any standard gradle plugin)   
2. Custom task actions 
  * attach custom build logic to tasks leveraging the `Task.doFirst()` and `Task.doLast()` methods 
3. Exra Properties 
  * Add your own properties to a project or task (including tasks not created by you, like gradle core plugins)
4. Custom Conventions 
  * Define custom naming conventions and project structure 
  * Configure default values for builds 
5. Custom models 
  * Can introduce new concepts/functionality beyond tasks, files, and dependency configuration via _source sets_

## Limitations 

1. Dependency management - gradle only supports Maven or Ivy-compatible repositories and filesystems
