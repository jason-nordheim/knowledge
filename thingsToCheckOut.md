        "description": "Because data is often received from the server in nested form, it needs to be transformed into a normalized form to be properly added to the store. The typical approach is to use the Normalizr library for this. You can define schema objects and how they relate, pass the root schema and some nested data to Normalizr, and it gives you back a normalized version of the data suitable for merging into your state.
        However, Normalizr is really only intended for one-time processing of incoming data. It doesn't provide tools for dealing with normalized data once it's in your store. For example, it doesn't include a way to denormalize data and look up related items based on IDs, nor does it help with applying updates to that data. There are a couple of other libraries that can help, such as Denormalizr, but there's a definite need for something that can make these steps easier to deal with.
        Fortunately, such a tool exists: Redux-ORM. Let's look at how it's used, and how it can make it easier to manage normalized data within the store."
