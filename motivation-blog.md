# Motivation, Software Engineering, and Global Pandemic 

Most people haven't had the _"best"_ 2020. 

## COVID-19

When COVID-19 rumors first starting surfacing, I dismissed them. At the time, there was no cases in the United States, and ignorantly assumed that the disease would be "contained" abroad, and that if it reached North America, we would rapidly develop a vaccine and it would be over. It wasn't until gyms, then restaurants and other businesses began closing their doors, it began to set in - COVID-19 was here, and nothing would be the same because of it. 

It may be incredibly tempting to ruminate on our misfortunes, or even shutdown in the face countless new and overwhelming challenges, but that simple cannot be an option. Can you imagine if our doctors, epidemiologists and other members of the medical community simply shutdown in the face of these challenges? What about all the "essential businesses"? Can you imagine what might happen?

## Software remains vital 

As with the medical professionals and epidemiologists, software engineers cannot simple "shutdown". Technology and software are more prevalent than ever. Slowing the pandemic is our responsibility too. 

How is software vital to a pandemic? 
* Doctors across the world need software to diagnose and treat medical ailments (COVID and otherwise) 
* Epidemiologists use software to collaborate, share/exchange ideas, and obtain information to combat the virus 
* Medical researchers leverage software to analyze the virus and understand it
* Manufacturing relies on software to drive the equipment of masks and other personal protective equipment 
* Online shopping enable high-risk individuals to get crucial goods and services delivered to their homes safely.

The list above isn't exhaustive, but I believe the idea is clear. Software is just as (if not more) important now, during the pandemic, than it ever was before. As we need medical experts, epidemiologists and doctors to work on slowing the spread and creating a vaccine - developers and software engineers need to continue using their skills to build software that helps address the evolving challenges faced by people across the planet. 

## Changing Mindset 

2020 has created enormous amounts of stress and changed nearly every aspect of our lives. While individually we lack the ability to solve some of these issues, there are things that we can do. There are ways that each of us can drive progress, innovation, and take action toward building a better world. I propose that we _need_ to focus on those challenges that we do have autonomy over. We need to focus on what we **can** do. 

As a "perfectionist", with a Type A personality - I find that no matter the skills I learn, the relationships I forge, the success I achieve, or the improvements I make to my health and fitness - I find myself dissatisfied. The truth is that most people feel this way. We call it "Hedonic Adaptation", which is the tendency for people to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite positive or negative life changes.

Obsessed with excellence, I've always been interested in personal development. Despite this interest, and despite my drive I never seem to feel **satisfied**, or **successful**. Unwilling to accept this, I've turned to Psychology experts and researchers in the fields of self-development, cognitive-psychology and behavior science to see what their research says about success. 

## Success 

People define success using a wide variety of measurements. I do **not** believe that success should be defined in terms of economic, political, or social status. When I use the terms "success" and "successful", I am describing individuals that reach high levels of achievement in their vocation. I want to understand what distinguishes high achievers from everyone else. 

Commonly people attribute success to talent, intelligence (IQ), economic status, social status, and even luck, but is there evidence to support that claim? 

### Grit and Success 

[Angela Duckworth](https://angeladuckworth.com/) is the author of [_Grit: the power of passion and perseverance_](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108), CEO and founder of [Character Lab](https://characterlab.org/) and is deeply fascinated with understanding why some people to be successful while others flounder. 

Duckworth became fascinated with the idea as a math teacher, she wanted to know why some kids succeeded and others failed. Through interviews with experts and pioneers in numerous fields, Duckworth sought to find common attributes that successful individuals had and how those contribute to achieving their goals. Duckworth summarize and relays some o what she has learned about success from industry leaders, academic studies/experiments, and research from others in [_Grit: the power of passion and perseverance_](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108). 

It turns out that the most impactful predictor of people that would achieve their goals could be most accurately predicted by that individual's "grit" for their vocation. **Grit was a more reliable predictor of success than genetics, personality/disposition, intelligence (IQ), social status, economic status and talent.** 

Grit is defined by Duckworth as "perseverance and passion for long-term goals". Gritty goals are the "ultimate goals" that have such significant importance that these goals organize and give meaning to everything you do. 

#### Being Gritty 

In an effort to be concise, the fundamental lesson's that I picked up from reading Duckworth's book are as follows: 

Successful People... 
* find their vocation **intrinsically interesting** 
* **maintain interest and passion** for long-term goals  
* find **purpose and fulfillment** in what their vocation
* embrace a **growth mindset** and **resist complacency** by using failure as a tool for improvement
* dedicate extraordinary amounts of time and effort developing their skills through **deliberating practicing**
* are able to **persist over challenges** by resolve to push forward **despite** the challenge. 
* **cultivate rituals** (routines) and practices that help them grow their skills and support their goals 

There are many factors that influence an individual's success, but foremost among them is the ability to remain interested and passionate in their pursuit of their "ultimate goals". High achievers persist and learn from setbacks, learning from those experiences and modifying their future actions. High achievers in every industry take an active role in their life, and routinely engage in "deliberating practice" intentionally placing effort on achieving specific short-term goals that support their "ultimate goals". 

## Making changes 

Armed with understanding the best predictor of success (grit), the next logical step is to apply the knowledge.

### Willingness 

New York Times best-seller _Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life_ by [Gary John Bishop](https://garyjohnbishop.com/) takes an unapologetic approach to achievement. Bishop argues that most people impose upon themselves limitations that prevent them from reaching high-levels of achievement. Bishop makes the assertion that "You have the life you are willing to put up with" - and asserts that by embracing a few assertions, we position ourselves for success. 

Bishop's 7 Personal Assertions: 
1. **"I am willing"**
    * Being "willing" to put in the work, bare discomfort, overcome adversity, and drive meaninful change is often challenging. It is often helpful to frame goals in terms of willingness. By determining what we are willing to undergo, we gain insight into what drives and motivates us. Inversely, understanding what we are **not** willing to undergo can provide just as much insight and direction into what is important to us, and how we should focus our energy.  
2. **"I am wired to win"**
    * Our brain frames every task and every goal as a game. One that may result in either winning or losing. In an effort to avoid "losing" people often attribute external circumstances, individuals, or conditions to their inability to achieve their goals. Or engage in negative self-talk that eliminates "winning" as an option. This can become a self-fulfilling proficiency in which a person fails to achieve their goals because they fail to believe they can. Wherever you are in life, you are really good at it. Even if what you are good at is procrastination. 
3. **"I got this"**
    * Failure to have confidence, results in inaction and stagnation. Believing in that "you can" is more important than actually being able to. Most people do not achieve high-levels of success without undergoing failure. The first step to accomplishing your goals is believing that you can. 
4. **"I embrace uncertainty"** 
    * It is impossible to know what will happen. With every action, there will be a consequence. It could be positive, it could be negative. There is no way to know how today's actions will impact tomorrow, next year, or next century. This uncertainty can result in inaction. Inaction breeds self-doubt. We must take action despite uncertainty, or as Teddy Roosevelt said: "In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing."
5. **"I am not my thoughts, I am what I do"** 
    * Negative thoughts, self-doubt, critical self views are part of human nature. Humanity has evolved to perpetuate dissatisfaction, because dissatisfied can be a powerful motivator for change. Dissatisfaction is unavoidable. Negative self-thoughts are guaranteed. There will be times where we are tired, stressed, overwhelmed, or having competing priorities. No one knows or is impacted (besides your) by negative thoughts, perfectionism, and uncertainty. Acting **despite** one's thoughts, is vital to progress and achievement.  
6. **"I am relentless"** 
    * Motivation and enthusiasm are not constant. There will be times where we "don't feel like it". Obstacles, people and/or circumstances may be stacked against you. Achieving high levels of success means that we must be willing to undergo the work. We must undergo negative self-talk. We must undergo doubt and criticism - but we cannot allow deter us from our goals. When everything else is stacked against you, relentlessness may be all you have left. 
7. **"I expect nothing and accept everything"** 
    * Expectations are dangerous because expectations attempt to predict the future. Importantly, the future is unknown, and without any guarantees. If the outcome of events doesn't align with our expectation, we experience disappointment. We need to harshly analyze are situations, accept our current conditions fully. Only by fully accepting our current conditions, and understanding how those conditions came to be can we alter our behavior and work toward another outcome. 

### Willingness, Relentlessness, Grit and Success  

At this point, certain ideas about what success is, and how success is achieved should feel redundant between both Bishop and Duckworth. The truth is that the two author's ideas are not contradictory, but rather complimentary. Angela Duckworth research helps us understand what is enables some people to become high-achievers while others do not. Bishop argues that we all need to take responsibility for our circumstances, and critically assess our current position and that we must both identify and be willing to commit the necessary time and energy to enact change. 


I propose that we change our mindset, and reframe how we look at this past year - Let's _choose_ to view 2020 as a challenge that offers new opportunities for growth, both individually and collectively. The simple truth is that COVID-19 is here. It is real, and the "normal" that existed prior is gone.
