# Getting Started with C++ 

C++ is an extension of the older programming language C and was the inspiration for the syntax associated with Java. 

Despite similarities in the syntax between C++ and Java, Java is a higher-level computer language (_closer to machine code_).

## Compiled 

C++ is a compiled language that _looks_ very similar to Java. However C++ code is compiled twice (2). 

First the code is passed to a _preprocessor_ and then to _compiler_ to create the compiled program. When C++ files are processed by the prep

## Data Types 

Data Types in C/C++ can be broken down into three categories: 

1. **Primary** (e.g. "primitive" data types ) data types are the predefined data types that can be used directly to declare variables. 
    * integer (`int`)
    * character (`char`)  
    * boolean 
    * floating point 
    * double floating point 
    * void 
    * wide character 
2. **Derived** data types are "derived" from the primitive data types 
    * function 
    * array 
    * pointer 
    * reference 
3. **Abstract** or **User defined** data types are defined by the user =. 
    * class 
    * structure 
    * union 
    * enum 
    * Typedef
