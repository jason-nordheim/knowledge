# Modern C++ 

Modern C++ should embrace the following fundamental principles: 

1. Expressive - keywords and constructs should suit specific needs 
2. Fully C++ - implements new features such as lambdas, templates, const and others. 
3. Readable - write code the is clear and concise.
4. Stack semantics - points are not your first choice, avoid manual memory management.

## Libraries 

The C++ Standard library is not the largest collection of libraries available when compared to modern programming languages, however it is growing. Its also important to note that although the libraries available for C++ may be relatively small, that does not negate their usefulness.
