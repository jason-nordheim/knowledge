# Failure - A pre-requisite to success? 

Being a developer or software engineer involves a variety of challenges, or as some might say - "Its hard". So how does one overcome those challenges? How does someone become "good" at software engineering? What separates the people that achieve their goals, from those who fail? 

## Fear, Evolution and Biology   

When we say something is challenging, what we are really saying is that is difficult. When we view something as difficult, or threatening physically, emotionally, or socially - our brain responds by releasing stress hormones which trigger myriad of chemical reactions in the human body. Muscles tense, pupils dilate, pulse quickens, breathing quickens, muscles fill with blood and much more. All of these chemical reactions preparing for one thing; to either fight or flee (commonly called the "fight or flight response"). 

Fear results the moment we perceive a threat. We _needed fear_ to help us respond to the threat and survive.

Despite centuries of evolution, when we perceive a threat (physical, social or mental), our flight or flight response prepares us to either run or give our everything to fight for our survival.

Most people today (especially developers and software engineers) live in a very different world. Unlike our ancestors that _needed_ fear to survive the harsh conditions of the world, the biological responses that occur from fear still exist today.

## Fear today 

Today we have many names for fear; anxiety, nerves, cold-feet, stressing out, and many more. Anything that threatens us, our family, our values, or our perceptions about ourselves results in the same biological response that kept our ancestors alive. 

The downside is that the _threats_ most people face today are not helped by the flight or fight response. Faster reflexes, increased strength, and reduced sensitivity to physical injuries won't help. 

In the world of programming - the flight or flight response is rather counter-productive. ************** Anxiety and fear raise our feelings of self-doubt and promote pessimistic thinking. 

It is increasingly evident that people will go to great lengths to 

Today fear is a response to uncertainty and risk. We are afraid 

The thing is, for most people we are anxious and fearful of, Uncertainty breeds anxiety and risk breeds fear. 

## Embracing Uncertainty

Uncertainty makes us uncomfortable and it is in human nature to incredible lengths to avoid uncertainty and discomfort. Uncertainty results in _risk_ and risk is results in feelings of _fear_. 


 is a constant, failure is abundant, and life is (across domains) is hard. Stop for a moment, and think about one simple question: _What are your proudest accomplishments?_ 

Life is  my own experiences, or those of people across the globe and throughout history.
